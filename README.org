#+title: Fetch Arte videos

*Download the videos in the `mp4` format from a list of links from the ARTE website*

** Requirements

1. a recent version of python (see https://www.python.org/downloads/ ). N.B. Most systems come with a python version pre-installed, check it by running the command: `python --version` 

2. some python modules (installed with pip, see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):
- "requests" (install it from the shell with pip: `pip install requests`)
- "numpy" (install it from the shell with pip: `pip install numpy`)
- "argparse" (install it from the shell with pip: `pip install argparse`)

** Installation

Two options:

1. clone the repository with `git`: `git clone https://github.com/yzerlaut/Fetch-Arte.git`

2. download the code in the zip format here:
https://github.com/yzerlaut/Fetch-Arte/archive/master.zip
and extract it where you want

** Build your "arte.txt" file:

Just copy-paste the links one by one from the Arte website (one per line).

Example of the "arte.txt" file content, see the file: https://github.com/yzerlaut/Fetch-Arte/blob/master/arte.txt

By default, you should just modify this file in the `Fetch-Arte` folder (remove the current links and put the one you want).

** Run the script

1. open the shell (command line interface)

e.g. on windows, open the command prompt by searching `cmd` in the Windows Menu

2. navigate to the directory 

e.g. with the command `chdir` on windows , if the folder was extracted as `Fetch-Arte` in the folder `Downloads`:
```
C:\Users\zeihr>chdir Downloads\Fetch-Arte

C:\Users\zeihr\Downloads\Fetch-Arte>
```

3. run the program by executing:

`python script.py `

** output

the script runs and downloads the videos one by one to the destination folder (the `Fetch-Arte/` directory)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
C:\Users\zeihr\Downloads\Fetch-Arte>python script.py
 ** /!\ the destination directory /media/yann/DATA/Arte/ was not found  /!\ **

---> setting the destination directory to the current directory C:\Users\zeihr\Downloads\Fetch-Arte

Check that the videos are in the folder with the command `dir` in Windows (`ls` on UNIX systems):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
C:\Users\zeihr\Downloads\Fetch-Arte>dir
 Volume in drive C is Windows
 Volume Serial Number is 9E40-DEC9

** Run the script with options

Let's say that instead of the default setting, you want that:
1. the `arte.txt` file considered is a file on the desktop
2. your destination folder is a usb drive located at `/media/yann/USB_STICK/`
3. the video is downloaded in the highest quality available, i.e.: 1280x720
4. the prefered language is german instead of french

you can run:
`python script.py --txt_file /home/yann/Desktop/arte.txt --dest_folder /media/yann/USB_STICK/ --quality 1280x720 --prefered_languages VOA VA VOSTA`

N.B. to deal with prefered languages, maybe one should use the different APIs, not the french one, to be discussed...

the different options can be seen by running:

`python script.py --help`

** More sophisticated/automated workflow using Web scraping 

*not woking yet* 

*but the jupyter notebook `notebook.ipynb` provides fragments of code to fetch the content of the Arte website using [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and thus automates the download (not needing to manually build the `arte.txt` file)*

** Organize your collection
